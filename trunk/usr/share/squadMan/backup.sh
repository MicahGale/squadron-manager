#This program is a very simple script to automatically backup the Squadron Manager database.
#it uses duplicity to backup the server locally and remotely on your schedule (set in crontab)
#A backup will be ran every execution so the backup schedule is controlled by crontab.
#the program primarily focuses on maintaining old backups.
#You can control how long the incremental and full backups are kept. 
#The incremental backups are done every backup and will be the first to be deleted.
#The full backups will be made when the incremental backups are deleted and will be kept for the time specified.
#The backup will backup the binary files of the database so the shell will need to be ran as a user with access 
#to this (usually /var/lib/mysql)

#Configuration options
#The location that the mysql server information is kept
DATA_DIR="/var/lib/mysql/"
#The location of the local backup
LOCAL_DIR="/var/lib/mysql-backup/"
#The remote backup url

#time to keep incremental backups remotely
