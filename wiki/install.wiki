==Requirements Before Installation==
To run Squadron Manager you need at least one computer, although it is suggested that you use a dedicated Server/computer to host the site.
===Hardware Requirements===
  *Must be running Windows, Linux, or Unix
  *A CPU with two or more cores running at 2gHz is recommended
  *At least 1GB of RAM is recommended
  *1-10gb of free hard drive space is recommended
==Installing Required Software==
You will need to install: 
  *A http sever- [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] is recommended.
  * [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL]
  * [http://us.php.net/ PHP]
===Linux===
To do this in Linux you just need to install the LAMP(Linux Apache MySQL PHP) package.

In Ubuntu you can run:
{{{
sudo apt-get install taskel
sudo taskel lamp-server
}}}
You should then remove taskel after installing the LAMP
{{{
sudo apt-get remove taskel
}}}
If you have a different distribution [http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/288158-easy-lamp-server-installation this link] may help. If not either Google how to do the installation on your distribution, or contact the developers.
===Windows===
You will need to install a WAMP, to do this follow [http://www.wikihow.com/Install-WAMP these instructions], but *_DO NOT_* install PHPMyadmin for security purposes, all database management should be done directly on the Server or over SSH.
