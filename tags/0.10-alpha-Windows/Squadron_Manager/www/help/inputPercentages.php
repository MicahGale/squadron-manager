        <strong>Inputting Percentages</strong><br>
        <p>There are three ways to input percentages into Squadron Manager, these are: as a percent,
        a fraction, or a decimal.</p>
        <p><strong>As a Percentage:</strong>To enter as a percentage, just type the percent as a number without the % sign
        (i.e. 80% would be 80).</p>
        <p><strong>As a Fraction:</strong> To enter as a fraction, just type the percent as the fraction of correct answers out
        of all the questions using a / (i.e. 15 correct out of 17 would be 15/17).</p>
        <p><strong>As a Decimal:</strong> To enter as a decimal just enter the decimal form of the percentage (i.e. 80% would be .8).</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Squadron Manager does not allow percentages over 100%.</p>
