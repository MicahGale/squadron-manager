In Ubuntu you can run:
{{{
sudo apt-get install taskel
sudo taskel lamp-server
}}}
You should then remove taskel after installing the LAMP
{{{
sudo apt-get remove taskel
}}}
If you have a different distribution [http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/288158-easy-lamp-server-installation this link] may help. If not either Google how to do the installation on your distribution, or contact the developers.
